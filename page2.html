              <p>The bench vice is a work holding device. It is the most commonly used vice in a fitting shop. 
                The bench vice is shown in figure below. 
                It is fixed to the bench with bolts and nuts. The vice body consists of two main parts, fixed jaw 
                and movable jaw. When the vice handle is turned in a clockwise direction, the sliding jaw forces 
                the work against the fixed jaw.</p>

              <h3 class="fs-2"> V‐ Block</h3>
              <p>V‐block is rectangular or square block with a V‐groove on one or both sides opposite to each 
                other.
                V‐block with a clamp is used to hold cylindrical work 
                securely, during layout of measurement, for measuring operations or for drilling for this the bar 
                is faced longitudinally in the V‐Groove and the screw of V‐clamp is tightened. This grip the rod 
                is firm with its axis parallel to the axis of the v‐groove.</p>

              <h3 class="fs-2">C‐ Clamp</h3>
              <p>This is used to hold work against an angle plate or v‐block or any other surface, when gripping is 
                require Its fixed jaw is shaped like English alphabet ‘C’ and the movable jaw is round in shape 
                and directly fitted to the threaded screw at the end .The working principle of this clamp is the 
                same as that of the bench vice. </p>
